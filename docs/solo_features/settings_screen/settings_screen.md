### Sound

| Setting        | Options                        | Notes                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Buzzer         | On / Off / Auto                | Auto: silences while BLE connected, re-enables on disconnect |
| Volume         | 1–5                            | LEFT/RIGHT; preview tone plays on each change                |
| DM Melody      | built-in / Melody 1 / Melody 2 / None | Notification sound for incoming private messages. `None` disables the sound for this event. |
| Channel Melody | built-in / Melody 1 / Melody 2 / None | Notification sound for incoming channel messages. `None` disables the sound for this event. |
| AD sound       | built-in / Melody 1 / Melody 2 / None | Sound played whenever an **advert** is received from *any* node — pairs with Auto-Advert as an audible "in range" heartbeat (see Tools › Auto-Advert). `None` disables the sound for this event. |
| AD scope       | All / Zero-hop                | Filters the AD sound so it plays for every advert or only for local zero-hop adverts. |

Melody 1 and Melody 2 are custom sequences editable in **Tools › Ringtone Editor**.

### Home Pages

|           OLED            |           E-Ink           |
| :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| ![](./set_scr_2_oled.png) | ![](./set_scr_2_eink.png) |

Lists all available home screen pages. For each entry:

- **LEFT / RIGHT** — move the page earlier or later in the navigation sequence
- **Enter** — toggle the page ON / OFF

**Settings** and **Messages** are always visible and cannot be disabled.

### Radio

| Setting   | Options    | Notes                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TX Pwr    | 2–22 dBm   | LEFT/RIGHT. With **Auto pwr** on this is the *ceiling* — the radio may transmit lower. |
| Preset    | named presets | LEFT/RIGHT cycles community RF presets (region frequency + bandwidth/SF/CR). **Enter** opens a popup to pick one, save the current settings as a named preset, or delete a saved one. Applies frequency, bandwidth, SF and CR together. |
| Freq      | chip range | **Enter** opens a digit-by-digit editor: LEFT/RIGHT moves between decimal places, UP/DOWN steps that digit. Bounds come from the radio chip's own validated range, so a value the radio would reject can't be entered. |
| SF        | 5–12       | LEFT/RIGHT. Spreading factor. |
| BW        | 7.8–500 kHz | LEFT/RIGHT cycles the standard LoRa bandwidths. |
| CR        | 5–8        | LEFT/RIGHT. Coding rate (4/5–4/8). |
| Pwr save  | ON / OFF   | **Battery saver.** Hardware duty-cycle receive: the SX126x cycles RX↔sleep on its own and wakes on a preamble, cutting average RX current. Trades a little receive latency; leave OFF for lowest-latency reception. Requires an SX126x radio (otherwise stays on continuous RX). |
| Auto pwr  | ON / OFF   | **Adaptive Power Control.** Lowers actual TX power on strong links to save energy, ramping back up — to the **TX Pwr** ceiling — on weak or lost links. Link quality comes from direct-message ACK SNR and, for channel messages (no ACK), from hearing a repeater rebroadcast your packet. The radio page / name bar shows the live power. Default OFF (fixed TX power). |

The **repeater** mode and its flood filters live on their own screen — see **Tools › Repeater**.
