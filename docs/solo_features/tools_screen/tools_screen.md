## Tools Screen

[Go back](../../../README.md)

### Overview

The Tools screen is a hub for GPS trail recording, nearby node browsing, ringtone editing, auto-reply bot, auto-advert, live location sharing, geo-alert, compass, device diagnostics, and repeater mode. Navigate the tool list with **UP/DOWN** and press **Enter** to open a tool.

## Nearby Nodes

|           OLED            |           E-Ink           |
| :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| ![](./tls_scr_2_oled.png) | ![](./tls_scr_2_eink.png) |

Browse nodes that have recently advertised on the mesh. **Filter** (which nodes) and **sort** (in what order) are independent axes and combine freely.

Filter by category with **LEFT/RIGHT** (one coherent axis — type only):

| Filter | Shows                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| All    | All known nodes                |
| Fav    | Upstream-starred contacts only |
| Comp   | Companion (chat) nodes         |
| Rpt    | Repeaters                      |
| Room   | Room servers                   |
| Snsr   | Sensors                        |

Select a node to see its coordinates, distance, bearing with cardinal direction, type, and last-heard time. A node that is **broadcasting its position** via Live Share is marked with a **♦ diamond** beside its name in the list (the same marker the map uses), and its detail shows `Sharing pos:` with the share age and whether it's DM-verified or channel-only.

**Hold Enter** opens the same **Options** menu everywhere (list and detail), in a fixed order — only the actions that apply appear:

| Action                 | Available when                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Navigate               | selected node has GPS — for a node sharing live position, the view follows it as it moves and adds an ETA line |
| Ping                   | a public key is known for the node                                                     |
| Save waypoint          | selected node has GPS                                                                   |
| Sort: Dist/Recent      | browsing stored nodes — **LEFT/RIGHT** on the row flips distance ↔ last-heard in place |
| Discover scan / Rescan | always (live `NODE_DISCOVER_REQ` scan)                                                  |

Filtering stays on the list itself (**LEFT/RIGHT** cycles the type), so there is no separate Filter action in the menu. **Sort** is adjusted in place: highlight the **Sort** row and tap **LEFT/RIGHT** to flip the list (and its right-hand column) between **distance** and **last-heard** without closing the menu — the same in-popup pattern as Trail's settings. The row appears only while browsing stored nodes (live-scan rows carry signal, not distance). Filter and sort are independent and **persist** across re-entry to the screen.

Selecting **Ping** opens the Ping popup:

|              OLED              |             E-Ink              |
| :----------------------------: | :----------------------------: |
| ![](./tls_scr_2_ping_oled.png) | ![](./tls_scr_2_ping_eink.png) |

Use **Enter** on the popup’s `Ping` row to send a direct mesh ping to that node. The popup then shows the RTT and SNR values on the next lines, and can be used again immediately for another ping.

> [!TIP]
> Combined with **Auto-Advert** on the other device, Nearby Nodes becomes a passive location tracker — as long as the tracked device periodically broadcasts its GPS position, you can see its current distance and bearing without any manual interaction on either end.

### Active Discovery (live scan)

|           OLED            |           E-Ink           |
| :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| ![](./tls_scr_3_oled.png) | ![](./tls_scr_3_eink.png) |

**Options → Discover scan** sends a `NODE_DISCOVER_REQ`. Repeaters, sensors and room servers within zero-hop range respond immediately with name, type and signal data. This is not a separate screen — it is the **same list switched to a live-scan source**: the right-hand column shows **RSSI** instead of distance, and node detail shows the public key, signal data and contact status.

Because it is the same list, all the same keys apply — **UP/DOWN** to navigate, **Enter** for detail, **Hold Enter** for the Options menu (where **Rescan** repeats the scan and **Ping** works exactly as on stored nodes).

- **Cancel / Back** — return to the stored-nodes list

## GPS Trail

|           OLED            |           E-Ink           |
| :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| ![](./tls_scr_4_oled.png) | ![](./tls_scr_4_eink.png) |

Records your route in a RAM ring buffer (up to 512 points, sampled every 1 s). Tracking runs in the background — a blinking **G** appears in the status bar. The trail survives display auto-off but is lost on reboot unless saved to flash first.

> [!TIP]
> The **Map** view is also reachable directly from the home carousel — the **Map** page shows a live mini-preview (your position, trail, and tracked contacts); press **Enter** to open the full Trail Map, **Back** returns home.

Cycle views with **LEFT / RIGHT**:

| View        | Content                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Summary** | Distance, elapsed time, avg speed or pace, point count, tracking status                                                                                             |
| **Map**     | Auto-fit dot-and-line plot with cos(lat) aspect correction; segment breaks marked; north arrow; square scale grid fitted to the map frame (toggle under **Hold Enter → Settings → Grid**, Map view only). Your **current GPS position**, all **waypoints**, and any **live-tracked contacts** (positions shared via Live Share) are always drawn — even with no trail recording — so the map is useful standalone |
| **List**    | Per-point rows showing local time (HH:MM) and delta distance from the previous point; segment-start rows show `start`; scroll with **UP/DOWN**                      |

**Hold Enter** opens the **action menu**. It is two-level — a short main menu, plus **Trail file…** and **Settings…** submenus. **Cancel/Back** in a submenu returns to the main menu.

**Main menu:**

| Item                  | Action                                              |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Start / Stop tracking | Begin or end a recording session                    |
| Mark here             | Drop a waypoint at the current GPS fix (see below)  |
| Waypoints…            | Open the waypoint list / navigation / add-by-coords |
| Share my pos          | Send your current position as a one-shot `[LOC]` message — pick a contact or channel (see **Live Share**) |
| Trail file…           | Open the file submenu (below)                        |
| Settings…             | Open the settings submenu (below)                    |

**Trail file…** (only the operations that apply right now appear):

| Item           | Action                                          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Save trail     | Write RAM ring to flash (`/trail`)              |
| Load trail     | Restore flash trail into RAM                    |
| Export (live)  | Stream live RAM trail as GPX 1.1 over USB Serial |
| Export (saved) | Stream saved flash trail as GPX 1.1 over USB Serial |
| Reset trail    | Clear RAM ring and elapsed time                 |

**Settings…** (values cycle with **LEFT/RIGHT** or **Enter**; shown only where they apply):

| Item       | Available | Action                                                  |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Min dist   | always    | Sample gate, 4 levels — metric: 5/10/25/100 m, imperial: 15/30/75/300 ft |
| Auto-pause | always    | Off / 1 / 2 / 5 min — auto-freeze the trail after a stop, resume on movement (see below) |
| Readout    | Summary view | Summary shows Speed or Pace (in the global unit system) |
| Grid       | Map view  | Toggle scale grid on the map                            |

(Trail file… appears only when a live or saved trail exists. Mark here needs a GPS fix; Waypoints is always available.)

**Auto-pause** — when set, a recording trail automatically **pauses** after the device has stayed within ~15 m of one spot for the chosen delay: the elapsed timer and point sampling both freeze, and the map line breaks across the idle gap. It **resumes on its own** as soon as you move again. This keeps a stop (a break, a meal, parking) out of your distance and average-speed stats without you having to remember to stop and restart tracking. A paused trail is still "on" (the **G** marker keeps blinking) — the Summary **Status** row shows `paused`. The stop is detected with its own coarse movement gate, independent of **Min dist**, so GPS jitter while you're parked doesn't keep it awake.

### Waypoints

A waypoint is a saved spot — your car, camp, a water source — that you can navigate back to later. Waypoints are **independent of the trail**: they live in their own flash file (`/waypoints`), survive a reboot, and are **not** cleared by *Reset trail*. Up to 16 can be stored — the Waypoints list header shows how many are in use (e.g. `WAYPOINTS 3/16`).

**Dropping a waypoint** — **Hold Enter → Mark here**. This captures the current GPS fix and opens the on-screen keyboard for a short label (up to 11 characters — e.g. `CAR`, `CAMP`, `H2O`). Leaving it blank auto-names it `WP1`, `WP2`, … Marking works whether or not the trail is being recorded; it needs a GPS fix (otherwise it reports *No GPS fix*).

**Adding by coordinates** — open **Hold Enter → Waypoints** and select the **+ Add by coords** row (always the last entry in the list). This creates a waypoint without being there — no GPS fix required (handy for a meeting point or a spot read off a map). It opens a small form with three editable rows plus **Save**:

- **Lat** / **Lon** — **Enter** opens the digit-by-digit scroll editor (the same widget as the radio frequency field): **LEFT/RIGHT** move the cursor between decimal places, **UP/DOWN** change the digit under it, **Enter** confirms. With the editor closed, **LEFT/RIGHT** on the row toggles the hemisphere — N/S for latitude, E/W for longitude.
- **Label** — **Enter** to type a name (blank → auto `WP<n>`).
- **Save** — validates the range and stores the waypoint. Missing or out-of-range values report a brief error.

**On the map** — saved waypoints show on the Trail Map view as a hollow diamond with the label's first two characters beside it (enough to tell nearby waypoints apart). Waypoints and your current GPS position are drawn continuously — even with no trail recording in progress — so the Map view doubles as a live "you + your marks" view, not just a recorded-track plot. With **no trail**, the view auto-fits to your waypoints and position. **While a trail exists**, the view frames the recorded route instead, and any waypoint that falls outside it is clamped to the nearest map edge — a distant mark can't blow up the scale and squash the trail.

**Navigating** — **Hold Enter → Waypoints** opens the list (each row shows the label and live distance). The list always begins with a synthetic **Trail start** row whenever a trail exists, so you can backtrack to where you began without having marked it. Select a row and press **Enter** to open the navigation view:

```
   CAMP            ← target label
   1.4 km          ← distance to target
   To:  145° SE    ← absolute bearing to the target
   Hdg: 090° E     ← your current course over ground (-- when stationary)
```

There is no magnetometer, so the screen shows two *absolute* bearings and you compare them: target at 145°, travelling at 90° → bear right. The **Hdg** line is derived from GPS movement (see Compass) and reads `--` until you move.

**Managing** — **Hold Enter** on a waypoint row offers **Rename** / **Delete** / **Send** (the *Trail start* row is navigate-only). Delete removes one at a time; there is no bulk clear.

**Sharing** — **Send** hands the waypoint to the Messages screen: pick a contact or channel, and the message is pre-filled as `[WAY]<lat>,<lon> <label>` (e.g. `[WAY]37.42123,-122.08456 CAR`) for you to confirm or edit before sending. On the receiving device, opening that message and **Hold Enter → Navigate / Save waypoint** turns it back into a navigable point (see *Messages › Fullscreen message view*). The format is plain text, so it stays readable on other firmware and the phone app.

### Downloading GPX

**Easiest — [Solo GPX Downloader](https://marekzegare4.github.io/solo-tools/)** (browser-based, no install):

1. Open the link in **Chrome** or **Edge** (Web Serial API required).
2. Click **Connect device** and select the USB serial port.
3. On the device: **Tools › Trail** → **Hold Enter** → **Export (live)** or **Export (saved)**.
4. The browser captures the stream automatically — set a filename and click **Download**.

**Script — `tools/trail_export.py`** (auto-detects the port, captures from `<?xml` to `</gpx>`, writes a timestamped file under `tools/gpx/`):

```sh
uv run tools/trail_export.py
```

Then on the device: **Tools › Trail** → **Hold Enter** → **Export (live)** or **Export (saved)**.

**Manual fallback** — open a serial terminal at **115200 baud** and capture the stream by hand:

- **macOS/Linux** — `cat /dev/tty.usbmodem* > track.gpx` (stop with Ctrl-C after the dump finishes)
- **Windows** — PuTTY (Serial, 115200) or Arduino IDE Serial Monitor with no line ending; copy the text from `<?xml` to `</gpx>` into a `.gpx` file

Saved **waypoints are included** in the export as GPX `<wpt>` elements (with their label as `<name>`), alongside the track — so they show as pins in OsmAnd, Garmin BaseCamp, GPX Studio, Google Earth, etc. Either way, the resulting file imports into all of those.

> [!NOTE]
> If the companion app is connected via **BLE**, the export is safe — BLE and USB operate independently. If connected via **USB**, disconnect the app before exporting.

---

## Auto-Advert

Periodically broadcasts a 0-hop advert with your GPS position. Configurable interval: off / 30 s / 1 min / 2 min / 5 min / 10 min / 30 min / 1 h. A blinking **A** appears in the status bar while active.

> [!TIP]
> **Audible connection heartbeat** — the device chirps each time it *receives* an advert from any node (sound chosen in **Settings › Sound › AD sound**). With Auto-Advert running on both ends (e.g. two people on a hike), each hearing the other's periodic advert becomes a hands-free "in range" beep — no need to look at the screen. It fires for **every** received advert, so in a busy mesh it can get chatty; choose `None` in **Settings › Sound › AD sound** to silence just this event, or set **Settings › Sound › Advert scope** to `Zero-hop` to limit it to local adverts only. You can also set **Settings › Sound › Buzzer** to *Off* (or *Auto*, which mutes while a companion app is connected) to silence all buzzer output.

---

## Live Share

Share your live position over the mesh **as ordinary chat messages**, and put other people who do the same on your map. A position is sent as a `[LOC]<lat>,<lon>` message — the same coordinate format waypoints use, so it stays readable on other firmware and the phone app (it just looks like a coordinate to anything that doesn't know the tag).

This is **independent of Auto-Advert** and runs alongside it: Auto-Advert announces your *presence* as a 0-hop beacon for Nearby Nodes, while Live Share sends your *position* to a specific channel or contact you choose.

The tool holds both directions of sharing in one flat list. Navigate with **UP/DOWN**, change a value with **LEFT/RIGHT** (or **Enter**); **Cancel/Back** saves and returns to Tools.

| Setting    | Options                     | Notes                                                                                          |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Track loc  | ON / OFF                    | Receive incoming `[LOC]` shares (DM and monitored channels) and pin those senders on the map / in Nearby. Off by default. |
| Auto share | ON / OFF                    | Periodically broadcast **your own** position to the target below while you move.                |
| To         | channel or contact          | **Enter** opens the Messages recipient chooser to pick the target channel or DM contact.        |
| Move       | 50 / 100 / 250 / 500 m      | Movement gate — only send after you've moved at least this far since the last share.            |
| Min gap    | 30 s / 1 / 2 / 5 min        | Minimum time between sends, so fast movement can't flood the channel.                           |
| Heartbeat  | Off / 5 / 15 min            | Optional keep-alive: re-send even while stationary, so the other end knows you're still there.  |

**How auto-share decides to send.** With **Auto share** on, the device checks a few times a minute: it transmits when you've moved at least **Move** metres *and* at least **Min gap** has passed since the last send — so a stationary device stays silent unless a **Heartbeat** is set. It also sends once immediately when you enable sharing (or change the target), so the other end gets a fresh fix right away.

**Receiving.** With **Track loc** on, incoming `[LOC]` messages update a small live table (up to 16 nodes, entries expire ~20 min after the last update). DM shares are keyed by the sender's public key (reliable); channel shares are keyed by name (best-effort, since channel names are unsigned). Tracked nodes appear on the **Trail Map** as a filled diamond with the first two characters of their name, and in **Nearby Nodes** with their live distance/bearing.

**One-shot share.** To send your position once without enabling auto-share, use **Tools › Trail → Hold Enter → Share my pos** — it builds a `[LOC]` message and hands it to the Messages screen to pick a recipient. There's also a shortcut from the home **Map** page: **Hold Enter** sends an immediate position update to your Live Share target while auto-sharing is on (toast `Position shared`), or opens the recipient picker if it isn't — so you never broadcast to a default channel by accident.

---

## Geo Alert

A single **geofence** that beeps and shows an alert when you cross **into** or **out of** a radius. The target can be a **saved waypoint** (a fixed place — "tell me when I'm back at camp") or a **live contact** (a person sharing their position via Live Share — "alert me when my friend gets near / falls behind"). A waypoint target is a **snapshot** (coordinate + label copied), so it keeps working even if you later edit or delete that waypoint; a contact target follows the person's latest shared position.

Navigate with **UP/DOWN**, change a value with **LEFT/RIGHT** (or **Enter**); **Cancel/Back** saves and returns to Tools.

| Setting | Options                          | Notes                                                                                  |
| ------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alert   | ON / OFF                         | Master switch. Enabling without a target prompts you to pick one.                      |
| Target  | person or waypoint               | **Enter** opens a picker — **favourites** first, then any active live senders, then waypoints; **UP/DOWN** + **Enter** to choose. **LEFT/RIGHT** quick-cycles the same set in place. A person is shown with an `@` prefix. Shows `none` until set. |
| Radius  | 50 / 100 / 250 / 500 m / 1 km    | Geofence size.                                                                          |
| Mode    | Arrive / Leave / Both            | Which crossing fires the alert — entering the radius, leaving it, or both.              |
| Beeper  | ON / OFF                         | Optional homing tone (see below).                                                       |

**Crossing alert.** When armed with a target, the device watches its own GPS fix and fires the alert (a short melody plus an on-screen message) the moment you cross the radius, according to **Mode**. The wording adapts to the target — `Arrived` / `Left` for a waypoint, `Near` / `Away` for a person. The edge has a little hysteresis so a fix hovering right on the boundary doesn't chatter, and the first reading after arming only seeds the in/out state — it won't fire spuriously just because you armed it while already inside.

**Following a person.** Pick a **favourite** (or contact / active live sender) as the target and the geofence tracks the distance *between you and them* using their latest shared position, so it works even while both of you move. You can arm it **ahead of time** — choosing a favourite locks onto their identity (pubkey), and the alert starts working as soon as they share a position. If they stop sharing (their share goes stale), evaluation pauses until a fresh position arrives — it never alerts on an outdated fix. A person must share over a **DM** for it to follow them (a channel share carries no stable identity to lock onto).

**Proximity beeper.** With **Beeper** on, the device also ticks while you're inside the radius and **shortens the gap between ticks the closer you get to the target** — slow near the edge, rapid near the centre — like a homing beeper guiding you to the exact spot. It's silent outside the radius. Because the beeper is its own opt-in toggle, turning it on **overrides the global buzzer mute** (**Settings › Sound › Buzzer**) — it's an explicit "I want to hear this". It works independently of the arrive/leave crossing alert (which does follow the mute), so you can use either or both.

> [!TIP]
> Mark the spot first with **Tools › Trail → Hold Enter → Mark here** (or **+ Add by coords**), then set it as the Geo Alert target.

## Compass

A heads-up GPS compass. The L1 has no magnetometer, so the heading is the **course over ground** — derived from how your GPS position moves over the last few seconds. The display is a horizontal **heading tape**: a fixed travel-direction pointer sits at the centre and the N..E..S..W scale scrolls underneath it as you turn, so whatever is under the pointer is your current course. A large numeric readout below shows that course in degrees and cardinal (e.g. `145° SE`).

Because the heading comes from movement, it only updates while you are actually moving: standing still shows *move to set heading* (and navigation's **Hdg** line reads `--`). Gross GPS jumps are rejected so a single bad fix can't swing the heading. The heading source runs whenever there's a GPS fix — recording a trail is **not** required.

| :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| ![](./tls_scr_6_oled.png) | ![](./tls_scr_6_eink.png) |

A step sequencer for composing custom notification melodies. Two slots — **Melody 1** and **Melody 2** — switchable from within the editor.

Each melody supports up to 32 notes:

| Parameter | Options                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| Pitch     | C / D / E / F / G / A / B / pause |
| Octave    | 4 – 7                             |
| Duration  | 1/4 / 1/8 / 1/16 / 1/32           |
| BPM       | 60 / 90 / 120 / 150 / 180         |

**Navigation in the editor:**

- **LEFT/RIGHT** — move between notes
- **UP/DOWN** — change pitch of selected note
- **Enter** — cycle octave of selected note

## Auto-Reply Bot

|           OLED            |           E-Ink           |
| :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| ![](./tls_scr_7_oled.png) | ![](./tls_scr_7_eink.png) |

Automatically replies to incoming messages that contain a configured trigger word (case-insensitive, contains match).

When the bot is enabled it listens to DMs by default. Channel monitoring is an optional addition — select a channel separately to activate it alongside DM mode.

| Setting       | Description                                                                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Enable        | ON / OFF — enables DM listening                                                  |
| Channel       | OFF, or which channel to additionally monitor (cycles through your channels)     |
| Trigger DM    | Word or phrase that activates the DM reply (case-insensitive). A lone `*` means **reply to every DM** (away mode) and is shown as `(any msg)`. |
| Reply DM      | Reply text for DMs; supports `{time}`, `{loc}` and sensor placeholders           |
| Trigger Ch    | Independent trigger for the monitored channel. `*` means **reply to every channel message** — bounded by the per-channel cooldown, but use sparingly on a busy channel. |
| Reply Ch      | Reply text for channel messages; supports the same placeholders                  |
| Commands      | ON / OFF — answer `!` query commands (see below)                                 |
| Quiet from/to | Local-time window during which auto-replies stay silent; set both equal (`OFF`) to disable |

The DM and channel triggers are independent, so you can run e.g. an away-message (`*`) in DMs while the channel reacts only to a specific keyword (or vice-versa).

The header shows a running count of auto-replies sent since boot.

**Throttle.** Auto-replies are rate-limited **per contact** (10 s), so a second sender is never starved while one contact is on cooldown. The channel bot keeps a single 10 s cooldown and won't echo a message identical to its own reply (so two bots running the same reply text on one channel can't ping-pong); the cooldown caps any residual back-and-forth.

**Quiet hours** suppress the push (trigger) replies between the configured local hours; a window where *from* is later than *to* wraps past midnight. Commands are a pull (explicitly requested), so they answer even during quiet hours.

### Commands

With **Commands** ON, a DM beginning with `!` is answered with live node data, independent of the trigger:

| Command   | Reply                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `!ping`   | `pong`                                  |
| `!batt`   | battery voltage                         |
| `!loc`    | GPS coordinates (or `no GPS`)           |
| `!time`   | local time `HH:MM`                      |
| `!temp`   | temperature (or `n/a` if no sensor)     |
| `!hops`   | how many hops the command message took to reach the node (`direct` if heard directly) |
| `!status` | combined battery / location / time      |
| `!help`   | list of available commands              |

Several commands can be combined in one message — `!batt !time !hops` is answered with a single `4.10V | 14:30 | 3 hops` reply (one transmission). A message with no recognised command falls through to the trigger bot.

Commands also work on the **monitored channel** (the one selected for channel mode) — anyone there can query the node. Channel replies are broadcast to everyone, so unlike DM commands they respect quiet hours and use the shared per-channel cooldown. DM commands use the per-contact throttle.

## Diagnostics

A single read-only screen of live device and mesh stats, refreshed once a second. On a small OLED the rows scroll with **UP/DOWN**; on a larger e-ink display they all fit at once.

| Row          | Shows                                                                                              |

| Total rx/tx  | All received / transmitted packets, summed across the categories below                             |
| Msg          | Text and group-text packets, `rx/tx`                                                                |

| Ack/Path     | Ack, path-return and trace packets, `rx/tx`                                                         |
| Other        | Everything else (requests, responses, control, raw, …), `rx/tx`                                    |
| Forwarded    | Packets this node actually re-transmitted as a repeater (reflects overhear suppression, if on)     |
| Heap free    | Free / total heap                                                                                  |
| Stack free   | Current task's minimum-ever stack headroom                                                          |
| Noise floor  | Live radio noise floor (dBm)                                                                        |
| RSSI/SNR     | Signal strength / signal-to-noise of the last received packet                                      |
| Pool free    | Free entries in the packet pool                                                                     |
| Queue        | Packets waiting in the outbound queue                                                               |
| Errors       | Radio error flags since boot/reset — `OK`, or tokens `F` (queue full), `C` (CAD timeout), `R` (RX-start timeout) |

The packet counters, **Forwarded** and **Errors** are cumulative since boot. **Hold Enter** opens a one-item *Reset counters* menu (Back dismisses it); the live readings (noise, RSSI/SNR, pool, queue, uptime) are not affected. **Cancel/Back** returns to the Tools list.

The counters make the repeater behaviour observable: **Forwarded** confirms the node is actually relaying (not just configured to), and **Pool free** / **Queue** show whether forwarding is exhausting the packet pool. See **Tools › Repeater** for the relaying options.

## Repeater

Turns the companion into a packet **repeater** while it keeps working as a normal companion — no separate firmware. By default, enabling it switches the radio to a dedicated repeater profile rather than relaying on whatever network you're chatting on (see **Network** below) — that matches the MeshCore community norm of repeaters sitting on a standard channel, not a private one. Loop-detection and an advert flood-depth cap are always applied. This screen keeps the toggle, the network/profile, and its flood-filter options together; live forwarding stats are on **Tools › Diagnostics**.

Navigate with **UP/DOWN**; change a value with **LEFT/RIGHT** (or **Enter** for toggles). **Cancel/Back** saves and returns to Tools.

| Setting        | Options         | Notes                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Repeater       | ON / OFF        | Master switch. The options below appear only while it is ON.                                                    |
| Network        | Current / Custom | **Custom** _(default)_: enabling the repeater switches the radio to a dedicated profile (below) and disabling restores the companion's settings — so you can drop onto a separate repeater network and come back. A never-configured device seeds Custom with a frequency in the same band as your own network (433/868/915 MHz region), not a flat one-size-fits-all default — so it can't land outside what's legal for your region. Switching to Custom afterwards (if it was OFF and unconfigured) seeds it from your current settings instead. **Current**: relay on the companion's own frequency — opt-in; not the community norm. |
| Rpt preset     | named presets   | _(Custom only)_ **Enter** picks a community/saved preset for the repeater profile. |
| Rpt freq       | chip range      | _(Custom only)_ **Enter** opens the digit-by-digit editor (chip-validated bounds). |
| Rpt SF / BW / CR | 5–12 / 7.8–500 kHz / 5–8 | _(Custom only)_ **LEFT/RIGHT** to adjust the profile's spreading factor, bandwidth, coding rate. |
| Skip advert    | ON / OFF        | Don't re-flood **advert** packets (the highest-volume flood traffic); messages and acks still relay.           |
| Max hops       | OFF / 1–8       | Drop a flood packet once it has already travelled this many hops.                                              |
| Yield          | OFF / x2–x9     | Scales the retransmit delay for **forwarded** floods only (your own sends are unaffected), so a mobile companion defers to better-sited fixed repeaters. Widens the window for **Suppress dup**. |
| Min SNR        | OFF / −20…10 dB | Drop a flood copy received below this signal-to-noise threshold, so marginal fringe traffic isn't re-flooded.   |
| Suppress dup   | ON / OFF        | If the same flood packet is overheard from another node while still queued to retransmit, cancel our copy — a peer already relayed it. Cuts redundant airtime in dense meshes; pairs with **Yield**. |

The five flood filters are **opt-in** (default OFF, so a plain repeater is unaffected) and act on **flood** traffic only — on a direct route this node is the named next hop, so it never drops those.

**Same network vs. separate network.** With **Network = Current** (or a Custom profile set equal to your companion settings) the repeater stays on your own network — you keep messaging while relaying. With a *different* Custom profile the device moves entirely onto that network while relaying (a single radio can't be on two at once) and returns to your companion network when the repeater is switched off. The profile also re-applies after a reboot if the repeater was left on.

While the repeater is on, a **»** indicator appears in the status bar (same blink convention as the auto-advert and trail markers) so you can tell it's relaying at a glance. Two radio settings are also overridden while relaying and restored afterwards: **Settings › Radio › Pwr save** is forced off (a repeater must listen continuously) and **Auto pwr** is forced off (a repeater holds full TX power for consistent relay reach). Both show `--` in Settings while the repeater is on.

Live forwarding stats — **Forwarded**, **Pool free**, **Queue** — are shown on **Tools › Diagnostics** (this screen is config-only).
